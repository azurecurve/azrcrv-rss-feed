Provides opposite rss feed to that configured in ClassicPress; e.g. if ClassicPress is configured for summary then an alternative feed called detail will be created, or if ClassicPress is configured for a detailed feed then an alternative feed called summary is created.

Once active, both summary and detail feeds cab be access using the following paths:
* http://yourdomain/feed/detail
* http://yourdomain/feed/summary

This plugin is multisite compatible.
